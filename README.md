# Final project: Recession predictor

**Research question:** Is the global economy on the brink of a significant downturn?

**Objectives:** Analyze current global economic patterns against trends from past economic downturns. This analysis will help in determining if the world stands at the precipice of, or is possibly within, a new recession. The aim is also to project economic indicators for 2024.

**Main indicator of recession:** Real per capita global GDP

**Further important indicators of economical activity:** Inflation, unemployment, government debt, house prices, current account balance, government expenditure, industrial production, trade, capital flows, business confidence

## Scope of the project

Macroeconomic indicators spanning 1961-2022 will be used for forecasting the indicators for 2023 and 2024. This will involve time series analysis and conventional regression modeling.

The derived forecasts will be input into a neural network to categorize the projected years as recession, recovery, or expansion phases..
